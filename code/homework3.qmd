#Problem 1

##a. 
For comparing time spent on campus/in class to daily step count, I could compare means of both groups to see if there is a correlation between the two variables. I would also want to compare the categorical variable of "type of workout" against step count to see if a particular workout type is correlated with higher step counts. Then to combine the two concepts I would also want to look if there is any relation between type of workout and the average amount of time spent on campus, for example if I spent less time on campus and in class, am I more likely to workout and/or have a higher step count. 

##b. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = personal_data, aes(x = time_spent_on_campus, y = step_count, color = type_of_workout)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(run = "royalblue", bike = "deeppink", none = "honeydew4", swim = "darkturquoise", yoga = "magenta3",kayak = "orange3", hike = "forestgreen" )) +
  labs(
    title = "Daily Step Count vs Time Spent on Campus \ncolored by Type of Workout",
    x = "Time Spent on Campus (hours)",
    y = "Daily Step Count",
    color = "Type of Workout"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```


```{r}

#plot of average step count grouped by workout

personal_data %>%
  filter(type_of_workout %in% c("run","bike", "swim", "hike", "none")) %>% 
  group_by(type_of_workout) %>%
  summarise(avg_steps = mean(step_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(type_of_workout, avg_steps), y = avg_steps, fill = type_of_workout)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "run" = "royalblue",
    "bike" = "deeppink",
    "none" = "honeydew4",
    "hike" = "forestgreen",
    "swim" = "darkturquoise"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Daily Step Count by Type of Workout",
    x = "Type of Workout",
    y = "Average Step Count"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

```{r}
#plot of average step count compared to time spent on campus??

# Scatter plot
ggplot(personal_data, aes(x = time_spent_on_campus, y = step_count)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Step Count vs. Time Spent on Campus",
    x = "Time Spent on Campus (hours)",
    y = "Step Count"

#Problem 2.


#Problem 3.

##a. Revisit and Summarize

The authors are using a Mann-Whitney U test to look at various challenges faced by management organizations and see if there was a significant difference between those rankings.

##b. Visual Clarity

Both tables clearly represent the data underlying tests because they provide a detailed list of each category within the response variable (ranking of challenges) and provide the test statistics to demonstrate whether the results for each challenge were significant. They tables also include helpful summary statistics such as mean and number of respondents. 

##c. Aesthetic Clarity

The authors did a good job handling "visual clutter" as all the words are nicely spaced out to make the table easier to decipher. The headers are bolded to help clearly distinguish data columns. They also italicized which category each challenge fit into which I think is helpful to the reader. 

##d. Recommendations
I think they could have italicized/bolded/underlined significant p-values to showcase the important findings of the test. They also could have separated the test statistics into multiple columns to make the results easier to decipher visually. For example, have an individual column for mean rank, U, and p-value.
